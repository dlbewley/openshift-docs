= Alternatives to storing administrator-level secrets in the `kube-system` project

The Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) manages cloud provider credentials as Kubernetes custom resource definitions (CRDs). You can configure the CCO to suit the security requirements of your organization by setting different values for the `credentialsMode` parameter in the `install-config.yaml` file.

If you prefer not to store an administrator-level credential secret in the cluster `kube-system` project, you can choose one of the following options when installing {product-title} on AWS:

* *Manage cloud credentials manually*. You can set the `credentialsMode` for the CCO to `Manual` to manage cloud credentials manually. Using manual mode allows each cluster component to have only the permissions it requires, without storing an administrator-level credential in the cluster. You can also use this mode if your environment does not have connectivity to the AWS public IAM endpoint. However, you must manually reconcile permissions with new release images for every upgrade. You must also manually supply credentials for every component that requests them.

* *Remove the administrator-level credential secret after installing {product-title} with mint mode*. You can remove or rotate the administrator-level credential after installing {product-title} with the `Mint` CCO credentials mode applied. The `Mint` CCO credentials mode is the default. This option requires the presence of the administrator-level credential during an installation. The administrator-level credential is used during the installation to mint other credentials with some permissions granted. The original credential secret is not stored in the cluster permanently.
